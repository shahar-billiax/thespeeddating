              - generic [ref=e127]: You can be creative and ask different questions to "What do you do for work?" or "Where do you live?"
              - generic [ref=e128]: We suggest you try more surprsing set of questions, like "Where would you go for a romantic holiday?"

            - listitem [ref=e136]:
              - generic [ref=e139]: Smile, Women are smile addicts. A few well-placed smiles, a happy attitude, some (non-erotic!) jokes here and there and you can win a woman's heart faster than a handsome tall guy, who is grumpy.
            - listitem [ref=e140]:
              - generic [ref=e142]: Stand straight and sit up. It shows that you are strong, well trained and not ill. And it will make you taller.
            - listitem [ref=e143]:
              - generic [ref=e145]: Use her name thruout the talks with her. This alone creates a more intimate atmosphere.
            - listitem [ref=e146]:
              - generic [ref=e147]: Even if you feel mentally close to the other person, keep your hands to yourself, its only a first mini date!

              - generic [ref=e149]:
                - generic [ref=e150]: Use deodorants. Under normal circumstances most women hate sweat odor. Hate it.
                - generic [ref=e151]: Its not even about using perfumes. Perfumes can be used additionally. The main idea is non-smelling, which is more important than good-smelling.
            - listitem [ref=e152]:
              - generic [ref=e154]: The reason of talking to a woman is to establish a relaxed atmosphere and to be friendly. Thus don't get involved into highly arguable subjects such as "Why death penalties for minors should be allowed" or "Why Greenpeace is doing more harm than good"
            - listitem [ref=e155]:
              - generic [ref=e157]: You should show a tolerant and open-minded attitude towards many subjects. Anything that can cause you a bad mood or her a bad mood should be avoided.
            - listitem [ref=e158]:
              - generic [ref=e161]: "Be aware that if you give vent to your feelings this can tell the woman that you are weak and she needs to be your talk friend. But to date her you need to show the direct opposite: That you are her strong shoulder; that you are self-confident; that you know what to do; and that she can rely on your emotional strength to be a help for her."

              - generic [ref=e163]:
                - generic [ref=e164]: If a woman asks questions who you are and what you do and what you want to achieve in life, then you should know what to answer. If you begin to stutter, flush red and say "Well, I have no clue, I am too helpless for this world" then this is NOT what they want to hear.
                - generic [ref=e165]: By mentioning your hobbies, your job, sport interests you describe yourself as someone with a stable background whom she can classify and trust.

            - listitem [ref=e167]:
              - generic [ref=e169]: Always look great, whatever your income. Gorgeous hair and some lipstick with rags will still turn his head. You have the advantage. You are the woman. Look your best. Looking your best will make you feel your best.
            - listitem [ref=e170]:
              - generic [ref=e172]: Never reveal information you don't have to. An enigmatic woman drives men wild.
            - listitem [ref=e173]:
              - generic [ref=e175]: Never ever talk about previous boyfriends, particularly their prowess in the bedroom. Your ex-boyfriends are your business only.
            - listitem [ref=e176]:
              - generic [ref=e178]: Assume nothing about your date until you choose to know him better. You cannot always tell by looking.
            - listitem [ref=e179]:
              - generic [ref=e181]: Men are seeking a woman who is attractive to them. Women may despair that men can be so shallow and that looks could matter so much but be careful. Men aren't necessarily looking for a catwalk model, but men do want a woman who takes pride in their appearance (though not excessively). Men are proud of having a girlfriend who looks good and I don't believe any man who says otherwise.
            - listitem [ref=e182]:
              - generic [ref=e184]: Men are looking for a trustworthy girl, someone they can have faith in and someone who will be there for them.
            - listitem [ref=e185]:
              - generic [ref=e187]: Men are looking for women who retain their femininity and and are caring and kind.
            - listitem [ref=e188]:
              - generic [ref=e190]: Men love a challenging woman, someone who keeps them on their toes.
            - listitem [ref=e191]:
              - generic [ref=e194]: Your posture is one of the most telling signals you transmit. An open posture is evidence of an open person. Turning your body toward the man you're conversing with, keeping your feet flat on the floor and leaning forward are actions that show interest.
