## PAGE 2: WHAT IS SPEED DATING (WhatIsSpeedDating.aspx)
**URL:** https://www.thespeeddating.co.uk/WhatIsSpeedDating.aspx

### What is speed dating?

"It is often heard that single people are wasting their time - a valuable one if you are a busy person, on a long date with the wrong person for you."

Speed dating is described as an efficient alternative to traditional blind dating where participants have "7 minutes meeting around 10-12 potential partners."

### How does it work?

"For a small amount of money, we will get you to meet around 12 professional Jewish singles in your age group."

Events occur at "local or centrally located trendy bar" venues. "The women stay seated during the event and the men move around from one table to the next when 7 minutes are up."

Participants mark scorecards indicating interest in dating or friendship connections.

### During the evening

Attendees check in, receive scorecards, and enjoy mingling time. "You will spend 7 minutes talking to the person opposite you" before marking preferences.

### Login process

"When you purchase a ticket to any event, you will be asked to enter some of your details, all kept confidential."

### Submitting your choices

Users login and select "Date" or "Friend" options for each person met. "A match is achieved once both sides choose each other."

### Updating your details

Users can modify profile information and passwords anytime.

### Forgotten password

Password reset emails are sent to registered addresses.

### How do I get my match results?

"The sooner you do it the better. once you have submitted your choices you can click on Match results in order to see the outcome."

"We will send you an email with your matches a week after the event regardless of the results."

Alternative submission methods include:
- Handing scorecard to hostess
- Emailing choices to info@ThespeedDating.co.uk
- Calling 0700 3401347

### Why do so many people come to speed dating?

"In one evening you have been given the chance to meet many different singles - men and women, where as if you were to meet any of them separately you would have had to spend two to three months!"

### What do we think this night is all about?

"We believe that this evening is not only about finding your date, but also about finding other friends."

"We pride ourselves with a relaxed atmosphere during our events and we do not like to create too many 'rules'."

### Success metric

"120 couples who got married as a result of meeting at one of events. Goes to show that Speed Dating works!"

## PAGE 3: DATING TIPS (DatingTips.aspx)
**URL:** https://www.thespeeddating.co.uk/DatingTips.aspx

### General Dating Tips

- Be who you are
- First impressions are the most powerful ones
- Try to talk and listen equally
- Avoid asking the same questions each time
- Be creative
- Try and make it entertaining

"You can ask any questions you like, but remember that first impressions count and being original is a plus."

"You can be creative and ask different questions to 'What do you do for work?' or 'Where do you live?' We suggest you try more surprsing set of questions, like 'Where would you go for a romantic holiday?' or 'What do you look at first when meeting someone for the first time?'"

"Enjoy dating for what it is, dating. It is meeting people and socializing and spending time in the company of stimulating individuals who may or may not play a bigger part in your life down the road. The fact is, most people have something interesting to offer. While you may not be out on the dating scene looking for new friends, you may well find one or two fabulous people along the way."

### Tips for Men

1. "Smile, Women are smile addicts. A few well-placed smiles, a happy attitude, some (non-erotic!) jokes here and there and you can win a woman's heart faster than a handsome tall guy, who is grumpy."

2. "Stand straight and sit up. It shows that you are strong, well trained and not ill. And it will make you taller."

3. "Use her name thruout the talks with her. This alone creates a more intimate atmosphere."

4. "Even if you feel mentally close to the other person, keep your hands to yourself, its only a first mini date!"

5. "Use deodorants. Under normal circumstances most women hate sweat odor. Hate it. Its not even about using perfumes. Perfumes can be used additionally. The main idea is non-smelling, which is more important than good-smelling."

6. "The reason of talking to a woman is to establish a relaxed atmosphere and to be friendly. Thus don't get involved into highly arguable subjects such as 'Why death penalties for minors should be allowed' or 'Why Greenpeace is doing more harm than good'"

7. "You should show a tolerant and open-minded attitude towards many subjects. Anything that can cause you a bad mood or her a bad mood should be avoided."

8. "Be aware that if you give vent to your feelings this can tell the woman that you are weak and she needs to be your talk friend. But to date her you need to show the direct opposite: That you are her strong shoulder; that you are self-confident; that you know what to do; and that she can rely on your emotional strength to be a help for her."

9. "If a woman asks questions who you are and what you do and what you want to achieve in life, then you should know what to answer. If you begin to stutter, flush red and say 'Well, I have no clue, I am too helpless for this world' then this is NOT what they want to hear. By mentioning your hobbies, your job, sport interests you describe yourself as someone with a stable background whom she can classify and trust."

### Tips for Women

1. "Always look great, whatever your income. Gorgeous hair and some lipstick with rags will still turn his head. You have the advantage. You are the woman. Look your best. Looking your best will make you feel your best."

2. "Never reveal information you don't have to. An enigmatic woman drives men wild."

3. "Never ever talk about previous boyfriends, particularly their prowess in the bedroom. Your ex-boyfriends are your business only."

4. "Assume nothing about your date until you choose to know him better. You cannot always tell by looking."

5. "Men are seeking a woman who is attractive to them. Women may despair that men can be so shallow and that looks could matter so much but be careful. Men aren't necessarily looking for a catwalk model, but men do want a woman who takes pride in their appearance (though not excessively). Men are proud of having a girlfriend who looks good and I don't believe any man who says otherwise."

6. "Men are looking for a trustworthy girl, someone they can have faith in and someone who will be there for them."

7. "Men are looking for women who retain their femininity and and are caring and kind."

8. "Men love a challenging woman, someone who keeps them on their toes."

9. "Your posture is one of the most telling signals you transmit. An open posture is evidence of an open person. Turning your body toward the man you're conversing with, keeping your feet flat on the floor and leaning forward are actions that show interest."

Matchmaking

### Body Text

"Many working professionals find it difficult to set aside time for personal pleasure and dating."

### How Does It Work?

Process steps:
1. "Register with us today to download our detailed questionnaire"
2. "Once we receive your questionnaire we shall get in touch in order to schedule a chat"
3. "During this interview you will be asked about your background and your preferences"
4. "Your photo can either be emailed to us or taken during the interview"
5. "Once you are fully registered, we will start searching for your perfect match"
6. "We will then contact you and arrange for you to start dating!"

**Lilah - London August 2011**

I thoroughly enjoyed meeting all the guys, and the hostess was utterly lovely, setting a relaxed, light-hearted and professional mood. I particularly enjoyed the setting, which was so brilliantly resonant. A brilliant night. Thank you! Lilah, London August 2011"

**Jeremy - NYC June 2011**
"I wanted to drop you a note to let you know I was very impressed with how well organized your event was last Sunday (5/31). While at first I was caught off guard by having my photo taken, I certainly saw the value of it when it came time to entering matches. It's especially helpful if you were 'on the fence' about someone and wanted to get a refresher of what they looked like. I am planning to attend more of your events in the future."
